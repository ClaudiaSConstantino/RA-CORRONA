The aim of this study was to find gene signatures in patients with RA at baseline (BL) and following 3 months of therapy (M3), 
which may help to predict the response to anti-TNF treatment. 
We propose a predictive model, based on dimensionality reduction techniques and on a consensus approach,
which uncover the most relevant genes to predict the response to therapy. 
We also use a Bayesian network methodology to discover relevant protein-protein interactions at baseline. 


The following files allow fully reproducibility of the results reported:

- Data extracted from NCBI-GEO database ("Transcriptomic_data");
- Data split into BL and M3 ("data_baseline" and "data_MO3");
- Data with protein-protein interactions from STRING database ("STRING_IDnames");
- R code used to process BL and M3 data;
- R code where we applied the same methodology as in the BL and M3 data to the top 100 genes reported by Farutin et al.
